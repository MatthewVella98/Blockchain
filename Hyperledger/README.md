# Hyperledger Fabric 

### In this repository, i will translate the Kickstarter.sol smart contract written in my Ethereum repository for the Ethereum blockchain, to run on the Hyperledger Fabric private blockchain using Hyperledger's JS full stack development framework Convector. 

### I will also build the same application using Composer, Hyperledger's conventional development framework and chaincode in Golang.
